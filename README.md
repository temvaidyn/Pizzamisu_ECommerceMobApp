# Restaurant Mobile Application on FlutterFlow using Dart programming language

## Aim of the project
The purpose of the mobile ordering system project is to create a mobile application for the Pizzamisu restaurant that will improve the customer experience and make it simpler for customers to place orders as well as keep them informed of the latest restaurant news. The aim of the mobile application is to provide an innovative means of enhancing consumer loyalty and service quality. The project's other goal is to create a mobile application that is both aesthetically appealing and functional and will increase brand recognition and customer loyalty for the restaurant. The mobile application must be functional and user-friendly. Customers should be able to view menus, place orders, and pay for food using multiple payment methods, such as PayPal and Apply Pay. In addition, the mobile app should provide restaurant updates, such as the most up-to-date news articles.
